            <p>I get high, way too fuckin' high...</p>
            <br>
            <p>This albums weird man, I remember being stoned as shit one time during a stream playing some GT4 and a
                chat member just popped in and made a song request.
                It's very rare I hear something so crazy and weird but this was it. The song in question was "I Get
                High" and it blew me away.
                Nothing makes sense, but I was high and for whatever crazy reason all the chopped up MPC samples and out
                of sync mixing made me feel something crazy.
            </p>
            <p>Main thing of note is the bass, usually so low unless you're using some decent headphones or proper
                speakers. Something about the way it moves and just keeps going kind of relentlessly.
                On top of all that there are some weird ghetto house vocal chops usually short and just constantly
                repeating in a trance like way. This whole album was just either a weird trip or some sort of sleeper
                agent activation and now I can't not use my expensive uncomfy headsets whenever I'm high. Thanks to this
                album.
            </p>
