            <h2>Review</h2>
            <p>Most likely the hardest album I've heard all year...</p>
            <br>
            <p>Bolt Thrower is one of those bands I can never seem to categorize without feeling wrong about it because they're pretty much the embodiment of why I like heavy and fast music. Raw firepower and energy without compromise. I can't really put the this album and the rest of their work into a concrete genre without doing it a massive injustice</p>
            <p>The album opens sounding straight out of a Warhammer 40K game cutscene, which isn't surprising seeing as the band where partially inspired by the game, hell, even the album art was made by Games Workshop.</p>
            <br>
            <p>From the menacing "Intro" it really only goes up from there, starting off with probably the most badass and straight up evil sounding guitar tone I've ever heard on "Eternal War". Fast pulsing riffs paired with machine gun drums and vocals sounding like someone sang them through power armour makes up the rest of the album, just pure destruction in audible form. Did I tell you this album sounds exactly like the art?</p>
