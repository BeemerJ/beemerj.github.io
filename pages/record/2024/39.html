            <h2>Review</h2>
            <p>Man, Godflesh is peak man...</p>
            <br>
            <p>First track I heard from them was a cover from Napalm Death on "Avalanche Master Song" and honestly it
                wasn't that big of a hit to me. All I remember was thinking, "Damn, this is slow as fuck".
                After getting their first release on download on my old Android phone from the school wifi, I remember
                listening to the album in full but none of the tracks really standing out to me but one, "Wounds".
                Something about how simple it is, robotic, cold and unrelenting. I was getting into the more electronic
                flavour of music as at the time I started messing around with production myself and something special
                about the way this song was made, structured, and the general vibe and simplicity of it stuck with me
                for the longest time.
                After a while the album kind of faded from my memory for a hot minute, except Wounds, something about
                Wounds man...
            </p>
            <p>I came back to it somewhat recently this year though fully with their second album "Streetcleaner". I
                heard the title track from an Earache Records compilation album a couple years ago along with some other
                artists I really got into from that compilation, but the recent revival of my interest in the band came
                from me checking the history of another afforementioned band called Napalm Death. The key link being the
                main guy behind Godflesh, Justin Broadrick.
                I would say that I've become more and more open-minded to different styles of music at least in the rock
                side of things and getting more into the slower things, not that Godflesh is "slow", but something about
                that Streetcleaner record (which I will review some time) and the vibe it gave off kind of gave me a
                better idea of why exactly I liked Wounds that much, outside of the production. Something more abstract
                and special that I have not really even seen replicated. Justin Broadrick magic.
            </p>
            <p>
                About the actual album though, well, it's pretty good. Harsh, low fidelity and noisey, very noisey.
                Justin does this cool thing with feedback that takes usual snippets in a usual metal song with it and
                just pushes it to the extreme with the feedback a core part of the actual song at times.
                The bass, oh my god the bass. It's sort of similar to what Napalm Death had on the first record (yes I'm
                making alot of ND comparisons) where it just cuts through everything and hits you like a truck, majority
                of the time being way louder than the guitar itself. It's distorted, crunchy and everything raw about
                the genre just put straight ahead and hits you like a truck. Standout tracks being Veins and Weak Flesh.
                You already probably know about the drums, there is no drummer outside of midi I guess. It's so robotic
                and mechanical and it probably any other context this is a bad thing but in context with the rest of the
                vibe, I cannot think of a better way of drumming in percussion. The layering on the kicks and just how
                insanely industrial it can get with the textures and repitition is so unbelievably metal it's unreal.
            </p>

            <p>Shoutout the Alesis HR16 though for real...</p>
