            <h2>Review</h2>
            <p>Man... this album just makes you FEEL cool...</p>
            <br>
            <p>The first time I heard a Kyuss song was on Need for Speed: Carbon, where it introduces one of the bosses
                as this cool american muscle car driving badass, and well, pretty sure they nailed it perfectly. Pretty
                much sums up how this album sounds, raw and badass with nothing to hide it.</p>
            <p>Yeah, I think raw is a good way to describe this. It really feels like you're driving 100 miles and hour
                on some tracks and still knows how to slow down on some others. Really low and dirty guitar riffs and
                pulsing drums carry most of the songs with some really awesome sounding choruses that sound like gravity
                itself is collapsing in on some parts. It rarely gets boring to listen to from just the soundscapes
                alone.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Take a trip into Sky Valley, 21st Street for life...</p>
